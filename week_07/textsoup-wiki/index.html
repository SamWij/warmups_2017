Our script is going to try to access certain elements in the DOM, so it will have to be loaded at the end
of the page, *after* those elements have been loaded by the browser... at least until we learn about
$(document).ready()
Note that our own warmup.js will have to be loaded after jquery.js too, since it uses jQuery and thus depends on it
already being loaded
