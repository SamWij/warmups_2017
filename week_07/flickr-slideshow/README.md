## Flickr Slideshow

Using [Joel's Flickr demo](https://github.com/wofockham/wdi-17/tree/master/10-ajax/flickr) as your starting point, create a page which loads a number of images via a Flickr API search using AJAX, and displays one random image from the results every N seconds, filling the browser window, fading from one to the next.

Your page should query the Flickr API using keywords supplied via a URL querystring.

#### Bonus

Collage mode: show smaller versions of each image in a random position on the screen, layering them over each other.
