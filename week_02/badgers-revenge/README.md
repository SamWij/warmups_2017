## Badger's Revenge

Fed up with students clapping him after every warmup, Badger devises a cunning plan to put an end to it - or at least _look like_ he's putting an end to it. You see, Badger secretly enjoys the adulation - mocking though it may be - so he doesn't want the clapping to stop altogether.

The names of those who are witnessed clapping Badger _more than twice_ in the first four days of any one week will go into a draw. On Friday morning, a random name will be drawn from that list and the 'winner' will be forced to deliver the solution to Friday's warmup.

Create a program that Badger can use for this task - ideally, you should create an object (`revengeOfBadger`) to do this, but if you can get it working using standalone functions, that's cool.

Your program should:

- Track how many times each student in the class has clapped this week;
- Include a collection of candidates for the Friday draw (ie, a list of names of people who have clapped Badger more than twice that week);
- Pick a random student to deliver the solution to Friday's warmup.
