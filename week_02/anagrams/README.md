# Anagram Detector

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the anagrams of the first word.

In other words, given: `"listen"` and `["enlists" "google" "inlets" "banana"]` the program should return "inlets".

## Suggestions

- Start out by getting this working with discrete functions.
- If you feel comfortable with that, try to put all your functions, collections, etc, into an object.
