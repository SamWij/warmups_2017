## Nucleotide Count

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

* twigs are to birds nests as
* nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as
* amino acids are to proteins as
* sugar is to starch as
* oh crap lipids

I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.

So back to nucleotides.

There are 5 types of nucleotides. 4 of these occur in DNA: `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`. 4 occur in RNA: `A`, `C`, `G`, `U`.

There are no other nucleotides.

Find how many of each nucleotides are in a string that you pass in to a function

Make sure that you validate that it has nucleotides!
