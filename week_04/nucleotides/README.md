# Nucleotide Count

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

* twigs are to birds nests as
* nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as
* amino acids are to proteins as
* sugar is to starch as
* oh crap lipids

I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.

So back to DNA.

Write a Ruby program that will tell you how many times each nucleotide occurs in a string. 

It should also tell you if a character in the string is _not_ a valid nucleotide.
